To connect to your office server and database from home, you'll need to set up remote access. Here are some steps to help you achieve this:

1. Set up a VPN (Virtual Private Network):
   - Install a VPN server on your office network
   - Configure your home computer with a VPN client
   - This will allow secure access to your office network

2. Configure your office router:
   - Set up port forwarding for necessary services
   - Ensure your office has a static IP address or use a dynamic DNS service

3. Enable Remote Desktop:
   - If you need to access the Windows program directly, enable Remote Desktop on your office PC
   - Forward the appropriate port (usually 3389) on your office router

4. Configure your database for remote access:
   - Modify database settings to allow remote connections
   - Ensure the database port (e.g., 1433 for SQL Server) is open on the office firewall and router

5. Use a remote access tool:
   - Consider tools like TeamViewer or AnyDesk for easier remote access

6. Ensure security:
   - Use strong passwords
   - Keep all systems updated
   - Consider using two-factor authentication

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps? Or do you have a specific part of the setup you're struggling with?
